# Ordinary Least Squared Regression

### Purpose
In this project I intend to explore and practice modules and methods available in puthon which help performing an OLS Regression analysis.

### Background
I used [this article] (https://towardsdatascience.com/ols-linear-regression-gauss-markov-blue-and-understanding-the-math-453d7cc630a5) as the reference for learning and understanding the theoretical aspect of OLS.

### Data
The data used for this project is from kaggle, [House Sales in King County, USA] (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
